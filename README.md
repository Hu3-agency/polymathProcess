# polymathProcess
The pOlymathProcess is an open-sourced framework that empowers people to deepen their knowledge and expand their creative potential. It’s a framework developed by the hu3.agency (“hu3”) to create a well-rounded content strategy for nOrm, but we’ll be using it for a lot more.

# hu3.agency and nOrm
hu3 is an open-source collective where individuals and organizations (hu3.agents) re-engineer the next version of society—Humanity 3.0. 

hu3 has a few projects in the works, but right now we’re focusing on how you can get more involved with nOrm (@ournOrm). hu3 uses nOrm to define the type of content we expect to see from Humanity 3.0 brands. 

Joining hu3 and adding your perspective to nOrm is as easy as using some well placed hashtags related to the polymathProcess (described below).

# what’s a polymath?
A polymath is an individual whose knowledge spans a substantial number of subjects, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems.

hu3 empowers individuals and brands from various backgrounds to turn themselves (and Humanity) into more effective polymaths. To make it all happen, we created the pOlymathProcess.
